          In a Changing World. <br /> For this year’s student competition, we’re
          asking entrants to consider the theme In a Changing World. <br /> Our
          world is changing rapidly, and we are looking for photographers who
          can show us positive stories of development and progress. This could
          encapsulate a whole range of different topics; from the environment,
          to technology, to the way we work and live. <br /> You may wish to
          focus on how we have shifted working patterns and office set-ups, how
          we are responding to the climate crisis in a more conscientious way or
          even particular advancements in technology and research. <br /> In
          five to 10 images depict how you, or someone you document, are
          responding to the changes around them. <br />
          Your images can be taken on any device, shot in any style – be black &
          white or colour – and approached from whichever angle you feel is
          best. <br />
          While creative responses are encouraged, it’s key to stick to the
          brief. <br />
          If your institution is not registered yet, you can register here.{" "}
